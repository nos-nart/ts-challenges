## Solution

To solve `7544-medium-construct-tuple`, we need to construct a type transformation that satisfies all test cases.

### Mental Model (ELI5)
Think of an array like a list or sequence of items in order. In TypeScript, we can inspect elements, spread them, or measure the exact count using tuple length.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Step 1: Analyzing the Requirements & Constraints**:
   We inspect the input parameters, establishing appropriate generic constraints to guarantee type safety.

2. **Step 2: Core Transformation**:
   We build the target type structure:
```ts
type ConstructTuple<L extends number, Acc extends unknown[] = []> = Acc['length'] extends L
  ? Acc
  : ConstructTuple<L, [...Acc, unknown]>
```

3. **Step 3: How It Works**:
Constructs a tuple of length `L`.

### Key Takeaways
- Type transformations occur strictly at compile time with zero runtime penalty.
- Clean generic constraints and pattern matching ensure robust type safety across all edge cases.
