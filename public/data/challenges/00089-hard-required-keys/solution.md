## Solution

To solve `89-hard-required-keys`, we need to construct a type transformation that satisfies all test cases.

### Mental Model (ELI5)
Think of an object like a dictionary or keyed record. Mapped types let us loop through all keys, filter them, or transform their value types.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Step 1: Analyzing the Requirements & Constraints**:
   We inspect the input parameters, establishing appropriate generic constraints to guarantee type safety.

2. **Step 2: Core Transformation**:
   We build the target type structure:
```ts
type RequiredKeys<T> = keyof {
  [K in keyof T as {} extends Pick<T, K> ? never : K]: T[K]
}
```

3. **Step 3: How It Works**:
Returns the union of keys that are required in `T`.

### Key Takeaways
- Type transformations occur strictly at compile time with zero runtime penalty.
- Clean generic constraints and pattern matching ensure robust type safety across all edge cases.
